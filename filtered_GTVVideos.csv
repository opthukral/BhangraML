This is as Folk as it gets, the entire set from start to finish is an absolute work of art, especially the Jhoomar segment. The singers voice is music to my ears, the boliyan are perfect, and Ustad Jolly Bawa Ji on the dhol is an absolute beast.

I'd like to apologize, to my viewers, for the poor audio quality. There were technical issues that I experienced with the sound technician, sadly I was not able to capture this band's performance in full glory. I am hopeful that the Bhangra Arena committee and I can work to avoid technical difficulties like this in the future.

Here are a few words provided by Shaan Punjab Dee, regarding their performance:

We received a standing ovation and also opened many debates. Some statements were made during a speech by a Judge regarding their performance that triggered the audience and the team itself but it only took place because of the lack of communication between the organizers and the judges. Shaan Punjab Dee seeks to gain more experience to form the best live performance that suits India as well as countries outside of India. At the end, everyone ended up with some things to learn. Future is expected to be BRIGHTER.

Wait no more :) What I find amazing is that Shaan Punjab Dee performed a few weeks prior to this performance, at Bhangra Fever 7, with a routine that was roughly 60% different. For them to change soo much, and execute it soo well, is an amazing display of the talent on this team. I present to you, Shaan Punjab Dee's First Place performance at Big 10 Bhangra 2017.

SPECIAL SHOUTOUT: Gurjeet Singh Pabla (GSP) the DJ who made the mix that Shaan Punjab Dee performed to. SPD had originally chosen a different set of DJ's to make their mix. Due to a misunderstanding, those DJ's leaked SPD's routine, in an effort to inflict harm. Ya'll just harmed yourself, because the spotlight could have been focused on you. Let this be a lesson to uphold respect and dignity in every situation. Gurjeet Pabla, big ups bruv! Bhangra teams, need a mix? Hit up GSP - HH

This video is special. This performance is special. Duniya De Rang is a newly formed Bhangra team, a special collaboration of entirely non-desi bhangra dancers within the Bhangra Circuit. In the society that we live in today, with negativity stemming left and right, this is such a beautiful beautiful thing to see, dancers from different backgrounds and ethnicities, coming together to celebrate our culture with us.

DDR hails from well known Bhangra teams such as Alamo City Bhangra, Anakh-E-Gabroo, Cal Bhangra, Cornell Bhangra, Da Real Punjabiz, Rochester Bhangra, and Virginia-Tech Bhangra. This performance was put together to demonstrate the love and passion each and ever dancer has for Bhangra and to thank the Bhangra circuit for introducing them to this art form. That being said, I hope you enjoy Duniya De Rang's performance at Big 10 Bhangra 2017.

In the past few months, the members of this team have dealt with many, many setbacks, but none so prominent as the loss of their teammate, dholi, DJ, and brother, Anooj Kumar Trivedi. 

Anooj was a member of KPGD when it first began in 2010, and had danced with many of the team members on Gajjde Gabroo and Gajjdi Jawani before that. His talents extended far from simply being an amazing dancer, dholi, and music production artist, as he was a genuinely kind-hearted soul who was always the source of entertainment and positive energy to all those around him. 

Khirre Phul Gulab De dedicates this performance in his memory, to a flower who didn't get the chance to fully bloom, to the person who reminds them how short and precious life is, and that we can and will push through anything and everything, for it is a privilege to be here. 

The tribute to Anooj Trivedi done at the end of this routine was not officially part of the routine, and KPGD asked not to be judged on it. His presence was felt with us that night and forever will each time we step onto stage.

If you ask me, I just say it like it is. Watch the first minute of this video, and you'll immediately see the immense amount of hard work and dedication this clan has invested into this performance. Did they make a few mistakes? Sure. Did some of their gimmicks fail? Absolutely. But they pushed the bar further (as always) and all you see on their faces are beautiful beautiful smiles as they pound the dust off that stage. Don't take my word for it, watch this video, I promise it'll be the best 9 minutes you invested into something today.

For those of you that disliked this description, life is beautiful, but short. Focus that energy into something positive. I still love y'all. Now watch my First Class family with their second place performance at Bruin Bhangra 2016.

I've been down the same road, on a Bhangra team that took years to finally place first, but when it finally happened, it was such a rewarding feeling. That's how I feel about this performance. Seeing this team grow over the past few years, I felt a personal sense of pride seeing them place first. This performance is clean. It is raw. It is simple, yet elegant. They mixed up such a great selection of music, and the choreo is absolutely on point, and it is a very well deserved First place performance.

I am happy to introduce to you, the First place team at Bruin Bhangra 2016 (the Super Bowl of Bhangra) Da Real Punjabiz.

For those of you who don't know, Tune Squad is a group that's comprised of many veteran dancers from the Bhangra circuit. Some of these dancers have danced on teams such as Anakh E Gabroo, VCU Bhangra, and Cornell Bhangra, just to name a few. Collectively, they have massive Bhangra experience, and it definitely shows in this unique and entertaining performance.

The future of the Tune Squad is not certain, as this set was a one time set made by friends who used to compete against each other at Bhangra competitions. They've now found themselves dancing together as one unit on the same stage. If that doesn't show you the power of music and Bhangra, then I don't know what will. Well done, gentlemen. I present to you, the Tune Squad Bhangra group at Bruin Bhangra 2016.

We need more dominant female Bhangra teams out there, to motivate and inspire the female gender. This performance is an amazing start to that journey.

For the non-Desi dancers of Duniya De Rang, Bhangra was not an inheritance, but a gift from their mentors.

-Mentors who taught them Punjabi traditions.
-Mentors who fostered friendships.
-Mentors who became family.

To give thanks, the team invited 16 of their mentors and friends from across the United States to join them on stage. The team spent weeks practicing hundreds of miles apart, and could only afford 1 full team practice the night before Bruin. 

Despite all odds, these 32 dancers hope their performance will help you, the viewer, remember the loved ones who brought Bhangra into your own life. 

Finally, the piano piece used, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, is special. It was the last instrumental duet Angela and her best friend performed before his passing, and then became the first piece she ever choreographed. This time, Angela would like to dedicate this piece to her teammates-- to thank them for their time and trust, and to never forget the love they felt together on stage.

DDR is built on two principles-- 1) to celebrate their passion for Bhangra, and 2) to express their gratitude for everything the Bhangra community has taught them about Punjabi culture.

Because these friends hail from across the country, DDR is never able to have a full team practice until competition weekend. As such, they view competitions as a rare privilege to experience the joy of dancing together; they hope that you, the viewer, can share in their happiness through this performance.

This is, hands down, their best performance to date! Their mix is sick, their outfits are sick (though I do miss the ties) and the energy level/choreo is on point. To my MOB fam, keep up the great work, looking forward to seeing what y'all bring to Bruin this year. Until then, I hope you all enjoy their performance at Bhangra at the Burgh 2016. 

I would also like to send a big shoutout to Viknesh Lakshmanan. I experienced a sudden death of an immediate family member a few days before this competition, and I had to cancel my trip to Bhangra in the Burgh 2016. I mailed my camera equipment to Pittsburgh, and Viknesh stepped up to the plate to record all of the team performances. Thank you, Vik!

Though I was not able to attend Bhangra Fever 2019 (I was at another competition taking place on the same day, Bhangra Blowout) the Bhangra Fever team and I worked hard to secure a good videographer to record the show. Regrettably, the person whom we chose to work with did not meet our expectations. All being said, I would like to send my apologies to all of the teams at Bhangra Fever this year, as this video is not up to the normal GTV standards.

We accomplish these goals by performing at numerous charity and cultural events for both our campus community and the community at large. Our team is known for our energy on and off stage; we are driven to inspire others with our passion, dedication, and unique style. Our performance is based upon a foundation of camaraderie, creativity, and spirit, all elements we hope will work to transcend social boundaries to build a sense of community and awareness.

Madak Mutiyaaran Di, also known as MMD, placed Third at this competition in a tie with another team, Ministry of Bhangra from Sydney Australia.

Though I was not able to attend Bhangra Fever 2019 (I was at another competition taking place on the same day, Bhangra Blowout) the Bhangra Fever team and I worked hard to secure a good videographer to record the show. Regrettably, the person whom we chose to work with did not meet our expectations. All being said, I would like to send my apologies to all of the teams at Bhangra Fever this year, as this video is not up to the normal GTV standards.

They could have stopped dancing, or they could have embraced that this was meant to be and continue dancing. They continued dancing. When you push forward, your side supporters push forward, the crowd pushes forward, and your new one drum stereo pushes forward. This, is what separates the boys from the men. This, is what makes you a winner. This, is an elite moment. Landing on stage via First Class Air flight E8BI15, this is First Class Bhangra with the most memorable performance of the night, perhaps even the 2015 Bhangra year.

Formed in 2010, but exponentially stronger in 2015; I'm glad to have gotten to know them the past few years, as their love and passion for Bhangra in Australia is unmatched. 

Though I had made a statement previously, in regards to my opinion of which team should have placed first, it is also important to note that my brothers from Sydney did an amazing job. Performing with 16 people on one stage is no easy feat, you guys did it well. My favorite part was the entire ""Guddi Wangu' segment. The choreo, the movement, the gimmick, well done. I have seen soo much improvement from you guys, you guys are most definitely one of the 'top tier' teams in Australia, and I cannot wait to see you again in the near future!

Performing with an army of 16 strong, this is the Ministry of Bhangra, representing Sydney Australia, performing at Bhangra Down Under 2015. The mix is absolute fire, one that you'll be sure to enjoy!

It is important to note that one team member is missing in this performance (Yellow Vardhi.)

This was the position of the beloved Rehmat Singh Sandhu, an individual whom not only performed on the Federation of Bhangra, but an individual who had an undeniable amount of passion and love for Bhangra in general. RIP brother.

This was also the last performance before retirement for Niketh Kuruvilla, Rishi Singh, and team captain Chanelle Singh. The leadership of these three has been instrumental in bringing the Federation of Bhangra to this stage, and we hope to live up to their expectations going forward.

This team, the 'Down to Bhangra Mutiyaran' being one of those teams. Not only are they a newly established team, they also managed to pull of a performance with 16 people on stage.

No disrespect to the other placing and performing teams! After following this team for quite a while now, I can say that this is by far their best performance to date. From their energy, their formations, creativity and absolutely excellent music mixing/selection, it's hard to differentiate BASS from North American Bhangra teams.

That being said, here is the Bhangra All-Stars from Sydney Australia (BASS) performing at Bhangra Down Under 2015. They placed Second at this competition.

Established in 2012, this team started out with 2 boys dancing at various weddings and parties. Now they have become the largest team in Melbourne and just pulled off the biggest coed performance in Australian Bhangra Histroy at this years BDU going in with a team of 16!

I received the pleasure of meeting this team at last years show, and it's refreshing to see how much they have improved across the board, in respect to choreo, energy, execution, and expressions. The new outfits are aesthetically pleasing as well. To MBR, keep up the good work - hh.

His debut album ‘One’ (released in May along with a national headline tour) received stellar reviews. Since 2009, he has toured nationally with Hip Hop legends Nas, Chali 2na (Jurassic 5), DJ Qbert, MC Supernatural, Talib Kweli and Dead Prez. Locally, he has shared stages with Horrorshow, The Herd, Hermitude, Urthboy and many more.

Following the release of ‘One’, L-FRESH The LION toured nationally across Australia; touching down in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide; taking his 7-member band with him. 

His latest single 'Survive (feat. MK-1)' was recently selected by MTV Iggy for their Best New Hip Hop playlist.

His sound is uplifting and universally accessible, inspired by the conscious, soulful Hip Hop movement in the U.S. in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Combine that with his love and respect for his cultural and ancestral roots of the Sikhs from Panjab, India, and you have an individual like no other in the music scene.

In understanding the social responsibility bestowed on him by the legacy of Hip Hop culture and his cultural ancestors, L-FRESH The LION has tirelessly dedicated himself to working in the community. In particular, he has aligned himself with many social justice issues.

He has appeared on Channel 10’s “The Project”, ABC Radio National and ABC Local Radio for his work in community and has spoken at a variety of events and conferences such as TEDxParramatta and for Amnesty International.

At present, he is an ambassador for All Together Now, Australia’s only national charity that exists solely to address racism.

He is also the founder of the Power To The Peaceful Community, a clothing label and online community that exists to encourage everlasting and meaningful dialogue around peace and peaceful relationships.

It's safe to say, they made a fan out of me. All being said, this is Bhangra Rulez performing at Bhangra Down Under 2018.

This includes along Ustad Manjinder Singh Dhaliwal, and other members of the Gabroo Punjabis, who help organize and teach Bhangra to the students. Solano Bhangra is a ""summer camp"" if you will, that teaches the students all about Bhangra, sportsmanship, discipline, and camaraderie. At the end of the Bhangra camp, this show is organized for the students to show the community, their parents, their peers, what they've learned over the summer. Some of these students have spent time on a stage before, and for some of these students it is their first time.
